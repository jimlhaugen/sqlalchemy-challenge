## Code Source and Its Location

The development of the code and script in this Challenge was performed by me personally; I did not collaborate with a peer.  Outside of the curriculum, I did not receive content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, tutor, or Learning Assistant.  

Unlike the previous challenges, I performed minimal internet research using Bing and rarely interacted Microsoftâ€™s AI Copilot, Stack Overflow, and few other sites.  The classroom materials and access to the lectures via Zoom were suffient and adequate to perform the challenge.
