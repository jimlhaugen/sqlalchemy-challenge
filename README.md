## Code Source and Its Location

The development of the code and script in this Challenge was performed by me personally; I did not collaborate with any one peer.  Outside of the curriculum and office hours, I did not receive assistance from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, tutor, or Learning Assistant. 

I did routinely, regularly, and consistently perform internet research using Bing and interacted quite frequently with Microsoft’s AI Copilot, Stack Overflow, matplotlib.org, panda.python.org, and numerous other sites responsive to my queries.  Besides course instruction, the internet has provided me with an invaluable resource for learning to code including this week’s challenge directed towards Data Visualization.  These websites provide examples of code and explanations resulting from my search queries.  While I may have copied and pasted code these code examples into the script, I modified or amended the code so that it was specifically tailored to the Challenge.
